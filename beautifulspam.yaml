term: beautifulspam

definition: |

  beautifulspam is beautiful enough to be allowed by moderators, but it is spam to 99% of users.

  beautifulspam is a form of censorship, sabotage, distraction, bluepills, DDOS attack.

  many "social" websites are flooded with beautifulspam,
  to hide interesting content (redpills).
  cover noise and hidden signals.

  beautifulspam is abusing forums as a chat room.
  its "content" is shortsighted, ephemeral, redundant, noisy, worthless, cheap, low effort.

  examples:
  "good morning"
  "today is wednesday"
  "jesus will save us"
  "how do i code hello world in python?"
